## Overarching Design Principles

Each design decision made while creating Fever should be taken so that they fit the description of the game below.

### Themes

Fever is a roleplaying game with a focus on the following themes:

- Horror
  - the occult
  - body horror
  - paranormal phenomena (ghosts, ufos, disappearings etc)
  - real crime
  - nightmares
- Drama
  - television-style
  - broken people encountering eachother
  - overcoming personal battles
  - no happy endings
  - dreams

### A session of Fever

Each session of *Fever* should feel like a standalone episode of an ongoing TV-show. One episode can be broken down into several sessions (especcially if time is precious). You can also continue playing the same characters from one session to another, but players (both GM and "strangers") are encouraged to keep their storylines short and sweet rather than lenghty epics. To further the analogy of Fever as a TV-show, it's more like ["Monster of the Week"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek) show of the 90s than the mini-series style shows of today.

### The player

### Scope of the game

In *Twin Peaks* we rarely see or even have characters reference the world outside the town, to the point where it's even suggested that "Diane" whom the main characters records audio tapes for isn't even real, and that the whole place might be taking place inside another characters' dreams. Similarly, *Fever* is, in scope, as big as exactly whatever the characters encounter in the town, and the surrounding world is not explored nor interesting unless it's explicitedly manifested in the town itself. If a player tries to leave Fever or gain access to the outside world (the internet and telephones exist), they should find that they simply can't, like invisible walls in a video game.
