## 1. A Session — What you need to know before you play

> ### What's a GM?
>
> The Game Master, or "GM" for short, is a player who does not play a character, but instead has control over everything else in the game. The GM sets up the scenes, controls all the monsters and NPCs (non player characters), and knows all the secrets that the session contains.

We're so happy you're here. Before you start playing, you should read through this book. If you're the Game Master, you should also read the [Game Master's Handbook](GameMastersHandbook), otherwise you should make a stranger.

### The World of Fever

Fever is a game, it is also a place and a state of mind. Fever is played over a series of scenes where a group of strangers encounter the hazy american town of Fever, Colorado. You need at least 2 players: 1 “Game Master” or GM for short, and at least one stranger. The game is played in two layers of reality. The first is called The Real, a somewhat oversaturated, dreamy reality with a focus on human interaction and investigation. Things in The Real doesn’t feel tangible, like everything was a symbol for something else and like every person is a paper thin character in a badly acted tv drama. There can be acts of violence but they are few and far between. The other reality, simply called The Fever, is a hellish nightmare where everything shows its true sinful face. Secrets are openly and blatantly displayed in a way that feel cryptic to us newcomers but obvious to its residents. Angst and Lies manifest into horrible creatures and obstacles. A troublesome thought in The Real can transform into a maddening labyrinth in The Fever. This reality is a prison only escapable by going through it.

### Materials

All you need to play is the following:

- This book
- Some friends
- 1 character sheet or GM-sheet per player
- 1 pencil per player
- A bunch of six sided dice (**d6 <i class="fas fa-dice-d6"></i>**), preferably in two different colours

### How to roleplay

### The File System

Many of the things you encounter while playing Fever, including people, places, objects, monsters, abilities etc. come with a **File** with all the necessery information you need. All files can be found, in alphabetical order, in the [File Cabinet](FileCabinet).

### Understanding Your Stranger Sheet

> ### Strangers
> Since the characters that the players control are visitors to Fever, they are called **Strangers**. This game uses the word stranger instead of "Player Character" in other TRPGs.

The stranger sheet contains all the numbers and things you need to play the game. At the top you have your **Stats**. These are numbers that tell you how well your character can do things in the game. Then you have your **Traits**. Traits can be abilities such as lockpicking, or some other attribute like having bad manners. When creating a character, the Traits you get will affect your Stats. Lastly you have your **Inventory**, where you can see the things the character has on them.

#### Stats

There are four main Stats in the game:

**<i class="fas fa-mask"></i> Psyche** [<i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i>](_files/Psyche.md) - your ability to discriminate reality from the horrors of Fever. When your psyche is broken, you collapse from straining your mind too hard.

**<i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> Stamina** - your ability to handle physical stress like running or fighting but also lack of sleep or food. If your stamina is broken, you pass out from straining your body too hard.

**<i class="fas fa-fist-raised"></i> Resolve** - your ability to overcome obstacles through sheer willpower. If your resolve is broken, you fail to find a purpose to go on and give in to whatever fate Fever has given you.

**<i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Sin** - your ability to commit questionable actions such as lying, theft, or even murder.

#### Focus Dice 

In the beginning of the game, each player is given a number of extra **<i class="fas fa-cubes"></i> Focus Dice**, equal to the sum of thier character's **<i class="fas fa-mask"></i> Psyche** and **<i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> Stamina**. These dice are a resource representing your character's ability to focus their energy on a task. The GM may award new points during the session *(or take them away!)* from activities such as resting or having a drink. There is no easy to way to gain new Focus Dice, so use them sparingly!

At the end of a session, note on your Stranger Sheet how many Focus Dice you have left.

#### Traits

Your stranger sheet shows each of your strangers **traits**. A trait can be any kind of attribute. Some traits have extra rulestext. Make sure to look up each trait in this book.

#### Inventory

A stranger can carry any amount of small items like pencils, keys, and such.
They can also carry one big item like a pistol or an axe. If they have a bag they can carry 5 big items, but they can only use one at a time. Note what items your stranger has on them on your stranger sheet.

### Skill Tests

The GM decides when there will be a skill test and decides on a number that represents chance of success. The players then roll **six sided dice (d6)** equal to their base stat where one die has to match or beat the GM's number. Before rolling, you may add any amount of **Focus Dice**, increasing chance of success and consequences of both failure and success.

#### Overview

1. The GM Decides which stat that will be tested and how difficult the test will be (Stamina 10, for example).
2. If the player has Focus Dice left, they can add any amount before rolling the dice.
3. The dice are rolled and it is summed with and any bonus or penalty modifier the player might have a towards the test (such as aiming).
4. If the sum is equal or higher than the difficulty of the test, they pass.
5. All Focus Dice the player used affects the outcome of the test positively or negatively depending on if the player passed the test.

### Violence

When an encounter with a human or a creature starts to get violent, the GM and the players take turns doing actions until the violence is over. The GM decides if any of the NPCs (Non-Player Characters) has surprised the players to get a bonus action before the violence starts. Then all players take turns in any order where their stranger can do one big action and one small action. Then the GM does the same for all NPCs, then the players have their turns, and so on.

> #### Anatomy
>
> Each character gets to do one turn until violence ends.
> A turn consists of a small action and a big action.

A big action is anything that would affect the other characters physically (punching, slashing, pushing, grabbing, jumping, lending someone a hand, etc).

Small actions do not affect other characters physically and does not take more than a few seconds (moving, shouting, picking up an object, locking a door, etc).

During violence characters are still able to talk to each other. Some items, like an axe or a gun, come with big or small actions that player can use during violent encounters.

All characters in the game has a **<i class="fas fa-fist-raised"></i> Resolve** stat, which is similar to Armor in other games. In the beginning of a violent encounter, each character gets a number points equal to their Resolve stat called **<i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i> Resolve Points** (RP) which is more similar to Health. When attacking a creature, the action you make decides whether you can spend your Stamina or Psyche and whether your Sin affects the outcome. Then you perform a *skill test* where the target sum is to roll equal or higher than the affected character’s Resolve stat. If the roll is a success, that character loses some of its RP. If a character has 0 RP, it will stop being violent.

In Fever, characters rarely die, as death is seen as a cheap way to get away with sins. Instead, the GM decides the fate the players should their characters reach 0 Staked Resolve. Usually the outcome is some sort of permanent damage that will haunt them for the rest of the game.

## 2. Making of a Stranger — Character Creation

A **Stranger** is a character visiting Fever played by you! Make your own personal stranger by following the instructions below.

When making your stranger, make sure to look up each **File** that is referenced in the [File Cabinet](FileCabinet).
Players can in conjunction with the GM also come up with custom files within each category.

### Choose a professional path

First off, you need to choose your strangers' professional path. Each provides a few Traits and Items for your character, as well as their starting stats.

### Choose a motive

Every stranger has a reason for them to come upon the town of Fever. Are they just passing through or are they there to investigate something? This is their **Motive**. Pick one of the motives below or make up your own in conjunction with the GM.
