# Main Design Document

You sit comfortably alone in the safety of your home, watching some late night drama show that you don’t particularly like. At some point you stopped caring about what’s on, you just need something to fall asleep to. The show ends, replaced by a fuzzy static but you’re too tired to reach the remote. You’re slowly, surely dozing off. The static fills your head and your mind. It’s like you could breath it. You no longer feel yourself inhaling or exhaling. Like a wave crashing the beach and retreating, the static fades to black…

## Welcome to Fever, Colorado

### What is Fever?

Fever is a game, it is also a place and a state of mind. Fever is played over a series of scenes where a group of strangers encounter the hazy american town of Fever, Colorado. You need at least 2 players: 1 “Game Master” or GM for short, and at least one stranger. The game is played in two layers of reality. The first is called The Real, a somewhat oversaturated, dreamy reality with a focus on human interaction and investigation. Things in The Real doesn’t feel tangible, like everything was a symbol for something else and like every person is a paper thin character in a badly acted tv drama. There can be acts of violence but they are few and far between. The other reality, simply called The Fever, is a hellish nightmare where everything shows its true sinful face. Secrets are openly and blatantly displayed in a way that feel cryptic to us newcomers but obvious to its residents. Angst and Lies manifest into horrible creatures and obstacles. A troublesome thought in the The Real can transform into a maddening labyrinth in The Fever. This reality is a prison only escapable by going through it.

### Two layers of reality

During play, the GM will secretly add points to a “fever” bar. When it hits a certain level. The players will start experiencing The Fever, a reality where hellish creatures roam. 
The GM then spends any number of fever points to manifest creatures and obstacles that the players must overcome.

### Skill checks

The GM decides when there will be a skill check and decides on a number that represents chance of success. The players then roll a D20 to match or beat that number.
Stats give you points in the beginning of the session. Spend points before rolling the D20 to increase chance of success and consequences of both failure and success.
The GM can award new points during the session (and take them away) from activities such as resting or having a drink.

### Making a stranger

Players are dealt cards from the different categories such as profession, traits or background. Then they choose one of each to make the stranger they want to visit Fever with.  Players can in conjunction with the GM also come up with custom cards within each category.

### Stats

**Psyche** - your ability to discriminate reality from the horrors of Fever. When your psyche is broken, you collapse from straining your mind too hard.

**Stamina** - your ability to handle physical stress like running or fighting but also lack of sleep or food. If your stamina is broken, you pass out from straining your body too hard.

**Resolve** - your ability to overcome obstacles through sheer willpower. If your resolve is broken, you fail to find a purpose to go on and give in to whatever fate Fever has given you.

**Sin** - your ability to commit questionable actions such as lying, theft, or even murder.

### Inventory

A stranger can carry any amount of small items like pencils, keys, and such.
They can also carry one big item like a pistol or an axe. If they have a bag they can carry 5 big items, but they can only use one at a time.

### Violence

When an encounter with a human or a creature starts to get violent, the GM and the players take turns doing actions until the violence is over.  The GM decides if any of the NPCs (Non-Player Characters) has surprised the players to get a bonus action before the violence starts. Then all players take turns in any order where they can do one big action and one small action. Then the GM does the same for all NPCs, then the players have their turns, and so on.
A big action is anything that would affect the other characters physically (pushing, grabbing or jumping, lending someone a hand, etc). Small actions do not affect other characters physically and does not take more than a few seconds (moving, shouting, picking up an object, locking a door, etc). During violence characters are still able to talk to each other. Some items, like an axe or a gun, come with big or small actions that player can use during violent encounters.

All characters in the game has Resolve, which is similar to Armor in other games. In the beginning of a violent encounter, each character gets a number points equal to their Resolve called Staked Resolve which is more similar to Health. When attacking a creature, the action you make decides  whether you can spend your Stamina or Psyche and whether your Sin affects the outcome. Then you roll a D20 and has to roll equal or higher than the affected character’s Resolve. If the roll is a success, the character loses some of its Staked Resolve. If a character has 0 Staked Resolve, it will stop being violent.

Characters, both human and creatures, seldom die in Fever, as death is seen as a cheap way to get away with sins. Instead, the GM decides the fate the players should their characters reach 0 Staked Resolve. Usually the outcome is some sort of permanent damage that will haunt them for the rest of the game.
