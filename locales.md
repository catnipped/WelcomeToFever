# Locales

15~20 smaller locales (single level)
~3 big "dungeon" locales (multi level)

## Smaller locales (any amount in town)

### Bus Stop / Train Station

*This place is the only way in or out of town except by car. During your time here, you never see a bus or train arrive and the timetables are out-dated by at least a year.*

**FEVER MODE**: There is a train/bus here but it looks old and abandoned. If you enter the vehicle, it won't let you out until you have searched it thoroughly, encountering what lurks inside.

### Roadhouse Diner

*Your run-to-the-mill Diner. The place was built sometime in the fifties and had some work done in the seventies. Everything is covered in linolium and fake wood. There is a dusty jukebox in a corner. The coffee is bitter and the food is just OK. Every dessert is sweet and sticky. There is a door with a round window leading to a kitchen. There is also a restroom with two stalls. The only other people here: A young waitress (male) and the middle-aged owner (female).*

**FEVER MODE**: There is a foul, awfully sweet stench coming from the kitchen. Every surface seems to be covered in an oily grease. There are damp stains and black mold in every corner. The jukebox is made out of phosphenous static. If you ate something recently, you feel nauseous and ready to vomit. If you enter the kitchen, you will find that the oily grease is thicker here, eternally seeping through every cravice. If you taste the grease it is sweet and acidic. If it touches your skin you can never clean it off. The restroom is surprisingly clean considering.

### Town Café

### Bingo Hall

### Video Store

*The local video place. There are blinds on the windows so you can't really see inside but it's always open even though the lights might be off. Once inside, it's a large room with rows of shelves with (empty) VHS cases of popular but older movies. There are a several "fat" CRT TV-sets hanging on the walls, but they are turned off. At the back of the store is desk and behind it a locked glass shelf with all the casettes. There is a smaller TV and VHS on the desk. Whoever works at the store seems to be on a break, they never show up. Beside the desk is a doorframe with an "adult" sign leading to a smaller corridor like room with porn casettes, there's another locked door at the back of the room. If you put your ear against the door, you can hear faint female moaning and male sighs from within.*

**FEVER MODE**: The VHS cases are gone, instead all shelves are filled with unlabeled VHS casettes. The TV sets are turned on, showing either static or show a live feed from invisible cameras in other places in Fever (this can be either their normal state or Fever mode). Some angles seem physically impossible, like the cameras were haning mid-air. Every single casette is a recording in first person of the final moments before a person dies. If you keep watching the casettes you will eventually be shown your own death (or someone you know). If you watch a casette from the "adult" section, you will instead see a birth in first person. The door at the back is still locked, but if you stay long enough, the **TAPEKEEPER** will emerge from within. The Tapekeeper is the Store owner transformed: he keeps a camcorder to his face, and tries to film you. If you meet the lens with your sight, it will black out all your senses (you can still move, talk, and so on) until it is pointed somewhere else.

### Local Library

*This small library is more like public hangout: there is an open area with tables and chairs that seems to be used for meetings. There are shelves along the walls and there is a door leading to an archive with more shelves of dossiers and older books. The archive is locked, only the librarian can let you in. There is a counter where you can talk to the librarian and use an old beige computer. The computer is connected but visiting modern websites has it freezing up and crashing. In fact, there is not much you can do on the computer except look for books and get basic information on everyday stuff. There is also a phone line that you may use if you ask nicely. But no one ever picks up if you call.*

*The library contains many interesting books but none are newer than ten years old. The closer the subject of a book is to the town, its history or its residents, the harder it is to loan it. It might even be lost or have pages missing. The librarian is a friendly and reasonable old soul, but has a hard time grasping the urgency that you might feel. The librarian is very protective of the items in the archive, you will have to come up with a very good reason to go back there.*

**FEVER MODE:** Most of the books that were in good shape are now withered and pale. Any book containing a *SECRET* is now calling for you, but they are ice-cold to the touch, and the words are all jumbled up and hard to read. Phantoms can be found sitting in the chairs or navigating the shelves. The computer is dead but the phone sometimes rings. If you pick up and listen, you might be corrupted by some ill-willing force. The door to the archive is gone, whether you are inside or not. If you remember where it was, you can use sheer force to get through to the other side.
